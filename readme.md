## Project Overview

**AutoLux** is a responsive web application designed to showcase a luxury auto detailing business. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring that the website is visually appealing and user-friendly across various devices.

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file provides the structure of the website, organizing content into sections such as the navigation bar, hero section, services section, and footer. HTML tags are used to enhance accessibility.

### CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file is used to style the entire web application. Key features include:

- **Responsive Design:** Media queries are utilized to ensure the website looks great on devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Custom Fonts and Colors:** The application uses a comination of Google Fonts and gradients.
- **Navigation Menu:** The navigation menu is styled to be sticky at the top of the page, ensuring easy access to all sections of the site.
- **Button Hover Effects:** Buttons and links feature hover effects that enhance interactivity and provide visual feedback to users.

### JavaScript Functionality

The `app.js` file contains a small but crucial piece of JavaScript that enables the mobile navigation menu. When the hamburger menu icon is clicked, the script toggles the visibility of the mobile menu, allowing users to easily navigate the site on smaller screens.

### To run the Web App in your terminal

Simply run open index.html or download and/or use the LiveServer extension in VS Code.
